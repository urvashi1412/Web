    <H1>Sun</H1>
    <p>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System.
        It is a massive, nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma,
        heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in
        its core, radiating the energy from its surface mainly
        as visible light and infrared radiation with 10% at
        ultraviolet energies. It is by far the most important
        source of energy for life on Earth. The Sun has been
        an object of veneration in many cultures.
        It has been a central subject for astronomical research since antiquity.</p>
